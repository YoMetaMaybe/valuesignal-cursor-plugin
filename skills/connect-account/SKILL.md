# Connect ValueSignal

Use a scoped API token (recommended) so you don't have to re-paste a browser
session token every few days. The token only allows capturing AI activity — it
can't access the account, billing, or data — and can be revoked anytime.

1. Log in at https://app.valuesignal.ai
2. Go to **Account Settings → Integrations & API tokens**
3. Name the token (e.g. "Cursor plugin") and click **Generate token**, then copy
   the `vs_pat_…` value (it's shown only once)
4. In Cursor: **Settings → Features → MCP → valuesignal → Edit**
5. Add environment variable: `VALUESIGNAL_JWT_TOKEN` = the token
6. Restart MCP or run **Developer: Reload Window**
7. Run the MCP tool `valuesignal_auth_status` to confirm

A short-lived session token (`sessionStorage.getItem('valueSignalToken')` from
the browser console) still works as a fallback, but it expires and must be
re-pasted — prefer the API token above.

Never paste tokens into chat logs or commit them to git.
